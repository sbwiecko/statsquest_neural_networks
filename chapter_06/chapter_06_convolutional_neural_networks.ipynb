    "In this notebook, we will use **[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [Lightning](https://www.lightning.ai/)** to create and optimize a simple [Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) like the one shown in the picture below. Convolutional neural networks are used for image classification, so when your phone thinks you've taken a picture of a cute kitten, that picture was probably classified with a CNN. In this case, we will create a network that can classify Xs and Os during a game of tic-tac-toe.\n",

Lastly, we run the max pooling values through a *simple neural network* with 4 inputs and 2 outputs.\n",
